# Privacy Policy for Enhanced Markdown Fixer

**Last Updated: June 19, 2025**

## Overview

Enhanced Markdown Fixer is a browser extension that automatically converts markdown-style text formatting (`**bold**` and `*italic*`) to proper HTML tags on supported websites.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

- No user data is collected
- No browsing history is recorded
- No personal information is accessed
- No data is sent to external servers
- No analytics or tracking is performed

## Data Processing

All text conversion processing happens locally in your browser:

- Text conversion occurs entirely on your device
- No data leaves your browser
- Processing is limited to converting markdown syntax to HTML tags
- No content is stored or cached by the extension

## Permissions Used

The extension requests minimal permissions:

- **storage**: To save user preferences (e.g., enable/disable, debug mode, language) locally in the browser
- **tabs**: To query open tabs so that updated settings from the popup can be applied immediately
- **Host permissions**: Restricted to `https://chatgpt.com/*` and `https://gemini.google.com/*`; the content script executes only on these domains

These permissions are used solely for converting markdown text to proper HTML formatting on the specified sites and do not grant access to other browsing data.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in the extension's store listing and updated documentation.
